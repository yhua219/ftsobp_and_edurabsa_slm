It really embodies" Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." While we did look at specific software like MS Word, Excel, FileMaker, etc., all of the units were accompanied by pearls that taught you how to apply what you\'re learning to almost any software. After taking this course, not only do I feel comfortable using some of the most common programs like MS word and Excel, but I am not afraid to explore new software if I have to. My favourite part about the course was the fact that along with learning the technical skills, it also teaches you how to be resourceful. The course is very well organized. The professor, Barbara, makes an active effort to keep students engaged( through fun discussions on Teams) and is incredibly helpful during office hours. The assignments are reasonable and actually help you learn.

It really embodies" Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime." While we did look at specific software like MS Word, Excel, FileMaker, etc., all of the units were accompanied by pearls that taught you how to apply what you\'re learning to almost any software. After taking this course, not only do I feel comfortable using some of the most common programs like MS word and Excel, but I am not afraid to explore new software if I have to. My favourite part about the course was the fact that along with learning the technical skills, it also teaches you how to be resourceful. The course is very well organized. The professor, Barbara, makes an active effort to keep students engaged( through fun discussions on Teams) and is incredibly helpful during office hours. The assignments are reasonable and actually help you learn.
