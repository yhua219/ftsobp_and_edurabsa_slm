Like any biology course, a lot of memorization is required, but Neufeld provides clear explanations and many resources to help you( e. g., video animations, lots of stories to relate the material to real life, and he also audio& video records his lectures so you can re-watch any you've missed or if you need extra clarification). Don't be overwhelmed by the material, it is completely manageable. The breakdown of the course covers 10 powerpoints(~ 40-100 slides each) and for grades: 5% clicker participation( doesn't matter if you get it wrong or right, just counts for participation), 35% midterm exam( material test is from 5 powerpoints), and a 65% cumulative exam( material tested is from 10 powerpoints). The final exam is much easier than the midterm and an overall 80 %+ in this course is very achievable. Personally, I found it most helpful to attend lecture and just listen and then rewatch the videos and take notes from that since I could understand the material at my own pace. Neufeld also uploads practice quizzes( doesn't count towards grades) to help you review material for each powerpoint. These are somewhat helpful, and most of the questions come straight from the textbook. You DO NOT need to purchase a textbook for the course. When studying for the midterm and final, MAKE SURE to review the clicker questions he has asked throughout the year( he will post them on learn), they are very representative of the level of difficulty to expect, and some of the questions are very similar or even the same as what you would see on the actual exams.

Don't be overwhelmed by the material, it is completely manageable.

The final exam is much easier than the midterm and an overall 80 %+ in this course is very achievable. Personally, I found it most helpful to attend lecture and just listen and then rewatch the videos and take notes from that since I could understand the material at my own pace. Neufeld also uploads practice quizzes( doesn't count towards grades) to help you review material for each powerpoint. These are somewhat helpful, and most of the questions come straight from the textbook. You DO NOT need to purchase a textbook for the course.
