It covers a wide range of topics including architectures, design patterns, stakeholder management, release engineering and many more. The course is mainly project-based, and the exam is really not that hard. The only downside is that the course makes you use android, which makes it hard to adhere to some of the requirements( using two architectures and two design patterns). It made me feel like I had to shoehorn them ino to meet the marks. Overall while you could learn these topics on your own, a 12-week course made super engaging meant that we were able to learn about all of these in more detail.",

But it was nice for us at least so get in while you can. Gym is also new and super fresh, it can get quite busy but there are a lot of different cardio machines and stuff so its usually fine. actual campus is also nice and modern.

Personally, I didn't find this course that interesting but Pinheiro has made it fairly enjoyable. It is easy to do well in this class- the mark breakdown involved 15% group work, which was probably the only time I was sociable this year and not bad at all. The marks coming from this part of the course are usually from coming up with just one multiple-choice question based on the previous week's content( an easy 15 %!). 10% comes from completing the textbook questions, in which the weight would be moved to the midterm and final exam if you don't purchase. 30% came from the lab- online, this was an easy 30 % as well lol. The remaining marks come from the 15% midterm and 30% final, both of which include fair questions, as long as you have good notes. I think the biggest mistake students in this course can make is having poor/ no notes. Otherwise, you can expect good results!",

While the course content is arguably better than the SPCOM alternatives, the teachers for this course make Karl Marx look right-wing. They have not a shred of logic in them( hence their pursuing a PhD in English), and despite being \u201cprofessors\u201d still cannot tell the difference between a verb and a noun. If you are caught doing anything besides giving undivided absolute attention to my particular teacher during the mind-numbingly boring mandatory classes, she seeks to personally antagonize you for the rest of the semester. I took the advanced level English course in my high school and was receiving mid-90s, but in this introductory bird course am somehow getting 20 percent lower than that. None of the assignments are properly explained and they are left open-ended, but when marked you are expected to have followed some sort of arbitrary rigid scheme that was kept a secret. In addition, if you use any words longer than two syllables in your papers the TAs get confused and take some marks off. The teacher has a very narrow perception and if you don\u2019t agree with her viewpoint are considered \u201cwrong\u201d in her eyes. You are forced to do a large number of \u201cquick-writes\u201d or else fail the course, and when they say \u201cquick\u201d they really mean it. Many times the professor asks you to write upwards of two paragraphs with 30 seconds left of class, meaning you stay overtime. If you are going to take this course, do yourself a favor and take it online.",

For a 100-level course, the expectations for students are very high and schedule is rigorous. You even lose marks if you miss more than 3 classes, which I found quite unfair especially considering that it was being taught during the pandemic. You will definitely leave with a decent understanding of basic German, but be prepared to do a lot of work. Additionally, the course is taught almost entirely in German from the get-go, and the textbook is written entirely in German. I think this is a huge flaw, as I had to continually translate everything on the internet as we progressed through the term. It's really hard to get a good grasp on the language when everything is introduced and explained in the language you are trying to learn.",

Didn't include a bulleted list in your assignment? There goes 20%. None of the information presented will actually be used in a real-life scenario, I showed my boss one of our assignments and he said if you had followed that format, he wouldn't even read it. No one I know has gotten above an 80 on ANY of the personal assignments and everyone seems to linger around the 65-75 range, ONLY to be brought up by weekly\" summary reports\". The whole idea of a ' fake company ' is idiotic, there's no context to the company and we have no interest in it since we don't actually work there. How can you make weekly group assignments for an online class, and then organize a 15-20 page assignment at the end as a group when half your class might be in another province. If you're like any other student that has to take this class, you've already had your first co-op term and know how to communicate in a business environment.

Little did I know that the prof makes you learn his own made-up language for the entirety of the course. At one point he was teaching a concept in class and bragged it only existed in his language( full coroutines). Half of the course content will leave you wondering why your time is being wasted learning this junk. The other half is covered in CS 350. The assignments are a little long, mostly extended by the fact that a large chunk of your time will be dedicated to trying to decipher what he actually wants you to do from the assignment outline. On piazza the prof and even the TAs are so intentionally obtuse and condescending to the point where you wonder if they have a bet going on who can be the worst. If I hear this guy say\" automagically\" one more time I'm going to lose my mind. This is the only course I've written a UW Flow review for, as it's by far the worst CS course I've taken in undergrad so far. If you're in CS, I wouldn't take this course if I were you. If you're in SE, I'd consider switching to CS.",

The content can be a bit dry( depending on where your interests lie) but Marcel always made the lectures fun and engaging. A lot of the information covered was new, not much was review from high school. The content was relatively easy to understand, but there is a lot of memorization: especially of comparison between different species studied. The midterm and exam were both fair. The textbook is not essential but can be a great help for understanding certain concepts, my professor also did assign readings from it for each chapter. Involved in this course there is also an essential laboratory component. It consisted of 5 labs using microscopes and drawing slides( which was very tedious) and 5 dissections. The lab was great to get a lot of hands on experience using lab equipment. Overall it was an enjoyable course and not too difficult!",

Whether he is discussing ciliates, complex life cycles, or whatever it may be, he is always very enthusiastic!

Extremely professor dependent as they may decide the 1 project you work on all term, which may or may not be of any interest to you. The actual\" content\" within the course is 3 lectures of repeating ME 100, ME 101, and PD 21. Everyone in the class skips or doesn't pay attention to any of these classes as nothing gathered from them will actually aid in finishing the project. The majority of the time is actually spent writing reports about the stages of the design process and planning, rather than actually making something that works. Grading throughout the course is extremely inconsistent between the professors and TAs which makes the course very likely to be an average killer for the term. Overall, the course ends up feeling like a complete waste of time in-between an already intensive 3B mechanical term.",

Half the lecture notes seem to just write an equation halfway and then just give up. Completely disorganized course. It is going to be a long semester. The first like 15-20 minutes of every lecture seems to just be the prof explaining which videos to watch because of the lack of organization on Learn, whether it be if lectures are not divided up into the right subcategories, or if they aren't labelled correctly. Update: Am learning more from redoing the mobius quizzes like 15 times( as there are like 5 different iterations of each quiz as they keep having errors) than the actual lectures",

Even though the first half is easy, make sure you know the content well. Starts with intro to ARM, moves on to logic gates and transistors, building up to low level circuits. Second half is Single Cycle Processors, Pipelined Processors, and Virtual Memory. Exams: Only had 1 this term due to COVID, but it was quite similar to the assignments. Doing the practice problems at the end of the assignments should prepare you thoroughly. Assignments: Simple assignments. Each one should take you no more than 2 hours to complete, and a lot of the content is in the slides.

        "text": "Dr. Engelhardt is a gem! She handled this COVID-19 term amazingly. In general, for 373 I would really recommend re-listening to lectures( you can ask for permission to record), it truly does make all the difference. She only tests what she actually taught( don't need to go into the textbook for anything). Personally, I found the midterms and exam very very fair( and on the easy end). Do the LEARN activity( renal handling, the neural one) before tests, its worth it trust me! Review clicker Q's as practice before tests to, again its worth it!! if your struggling there's loads of youtube videos to help supplement, but make sure you stay on top because things do build.",

The quizzes themselves were open book and mostly involve testing course content, if you lightly trimmed through readings you can get an idea for how to answer the questions during the quiz for the reading ones.

It is not only a super easy course if you put in the work, but you come out with the knowledge that is relevant to the industry. This course has 4 assignments at 20% each and 5 quizzes at 4% each. A1-A3 is desktop based and A4 is Android development, although this may change in the future to be fully android. The biggest downside of this course is that there isn't enough time to cover everything, so A4 tends to be quite tough since android is generally tough to do. The quizzes are pretty standard and are really just there for confirming knowledge. I would take this course if you're interested in learning about how to build better UI's and get familiar with modern development stacks like Kotlin",

That being said, most of the live lectures were spent reviewing the recorded lectures. He also assigned homework during a lot of lectures, which isn't necessary but helps to engage with the content as you go. Marking scheme was pretty nice, with a lot of weight put on 6 assignments and 2 projects. They were pretty straightforward but could be very time-consuming.

Like any biology course, a lot of memorization is required, but Neufeld provides clear explanations and many resources to help you( e. g., video animations, lots of stories to relate the material to real life, and he also audio& video records his lectures so you can re-watch any you've missed or if you need extra clarification). Don't be overwhelmed by the material, it is completely manageable. The breakdown of the course covers 10 powerpoints(~ 40-100 slides each) and for grades: 5% clicker participation( doesn't matter if you get it wrong or right, just counts for participation), 35% midterm exam( material test is from 5 powerpoints), and a 65% cumulative exam( material tested is from 10 powerpoints). The final exam is much easier than the midterm and an overall 80 %+ in this course is very achievable. Personally, I found it most helpful to attend lecture and just listen and then rewatch the videos and take notes from that since I could understand the material at my own pace. Neufeld also uploads practice quizzes( doesn't count towards grades) to help you review material for each powerpoint. These are somewhat helpful, and most of the questions come straight from the textbook. You DO NOT need to purchase a textbook for the course. When studying for the midterm and final, MAKE SURE to review the clicker questions he has asked throughout the year( he will post them on learn), they are very representative of the level of difficulty to expect, and some of the questions are very similar or even the same as what you would see on the actual exams. Good luck!",

Our lab marks were in the mid to high 90's so we felt the marking was fair and the labs were do-able. However with that being said, some labs took my lab partner and I 50 + hours to complete. The midterm was challenging but not impossible if you study hard for it. Make sure you complete lab 1 because the next few labs require building on top of your previous existing ones!

First 2 units of the course are actually quite good even though it's mostly just a review of MODS. However, the course takes a drastic dive afterwards. Fatigue is all I felt during the entire unit about fatigue. I also never cared enough about shafts, fasteners, or weld designs to be interested by anything in the second half of the course. This is generally regarded as one of the \" easier \" courses in 3B, but it's still not interesting.",

We had to build a neural network from scratch, with almost no help from the lectures or slides, a task that could've been done with keras in 5 minutes, as part of one assignment. The data challenges were interesting, but all the coding had to be self-taught, because the prof only taught the theoretical parts. Don't know how to use python generators? Have fun cleaning 6 million data entries and storing them in a h5 database. The prof I had, Ali, was almost completely off the map. He showed up for lectures but that was absolutely it; no office hours, didn't respond to emails. Is he even a prof here, or is he just some guy pulling an elaborate ruse to screw over desperate math students? I went to his office twice and he wasn't there either time, the TA's were constantly overworked and had to turn away long lines of students every time I went to office hours.",

It reminded me of memorisation-heavy high school courses that feed you information, never explaining why they are true or why you would ever need to know them. Some reviews below claim that most statements are common sense, but as someone who has never taken econ in high school, I find that there are several unjustified claims in the modules, such as\" why is ATC minimized when MC= AVC?\" I later found a proof of this using calculus, but nonetheless there is zero reason to expect this to be true using\" common sense\", nor was there any reasoning of this in the module. There were a lot of erroneous questions( like two MCQ choices are the same) on the quizzes , midterms and final, and you don't get the answers after each quiz, so overall the quality of the presentation and assessments were likewise nonexistent. They claim they hide the answers for copyright reasons but 90% of the questions can be found on quizlet. The textbook was completely unnecessary. Further, the prof's presence was nonexistent. First asynchronous course though, so I'm not sure if all asynchronous courses are as garbage as this one.",

The prof is super nice and by the end of the course you will have become semi-proficient at introductory MEMS( or you will have failed). This term there were 4 labs, 3 homework assignments( almost 4), 2\" tutorials\" that give experience using the MEMS equivalent of CAD software, and a handful of in-class exercises which made up the bulk of the grades. Each of those is not worth a lot but takes a fair amount of time to complete. Those,( plus some i-clicker questions, etc.), made up about 45% of the grades while the midterm and final were 25% and 30% respectively. It is worth it get as much of the 45% as possible because the course is designed so that the exams bring the average down. It would be WAY easier to do well on the exams if there were more practice questions with good solutions to get more experience with solving MEMS level problems.",

There were no tests / midterms / final( which I didnt mind but i feel as though people wouldve done better if there were some), only assignments based off of mock fieldwork that you did at a site of your choosing. I enjoyed the aspect of doing fieldwork , taking fieldnotes, etc. but the assignments were a whole different story. We did not receive outlines, nor were we given clear instructions of what was expected us. The assignments were then marked quite harshly and we received little feedback on how we could improve our work. I somehow managed to pull off an 81 in the course, but i feel as though I, as well as others I talked to in the class, couldve done better is we knew what was expected of us. So, in general, I did not enjoy this class as much as I had hoped but the experience of going out and doing fieldwork was useful. This is the first time this course has been offered though, and based on complaints from people in my class, I feel as like the structure of the class will be subject to change and expectations will be made more clear. next time.",

The concepts were not super interesting since I really only enjoy applied CS stuff hahaha, but it was not dry and boring either. The one aspect I really liked about this course is that it is applied, there were not any proof questions whatsoever which was superb. If you enjoy something applied and are at least somewhat interested in data science, you would enjoy this course. My complaint about this course is that it felt like you literally self-taught yourself in this course, the instructors will not help you on the assignments( at least in my offering). There were lecture video and weekly recap but I found the course note to be your best bet to learn the materials as it explained concepts thoroughly with so many examples and practice problems( which make me happy since some math class just assume you know a lot or are proficient enough at math, def not me haha). Overall quite a decent course.",

So he literally gave us 2 seconds to write down the solution and simultaneously try and listen to his reasoning and move through the material as fast as possible. Poor move, considering the\" copyright infringement\" excuse is probably just a reason for him not to post and drop everyone's marks as a result. With such smart people I have no idea why you would do this- maybe it's the program's \" business model .\"",

Every week you have either a quiz or a 600-word assignment due worth 7%, and there is one midterm worth 11%, one final worth 11% and a final 1800-word paper worth 18%. The assignments took quite a bit of time( for a weekly thing) and were marked quite hard. The prof writes the course readings and posts 3-4 days after the lecture, even when you have an assignment due on that lecture that week. His notes are long and dense and the quiz questions are never on the broad topics or main points, but instead are usually on the nitty-gritty. He is fast to respond my email but is not forgiving with remarks. Some of the quiz questions only ~ 30 % of the class would get them correct and he would not consider that it was an unfair question. Overall, I would never take again, I am happy it is over, and I would not recommend to a friend.",

There are also 3 tests in total which are very heavy weighted, making them count for 85% of your grade( first test-30%/ second test-30%/ third test-25%). They consist of short answer, long answer and/ or essay questions. The rest of the 15% is from your discussions. Would not recommend if you're not that into philosophy.",

        "text": "This was honestly the worst course I had ever taken. I almost dropped out of the program entirely because of it. The course is split up into 2 portions: DCAP and EGAD. DCAP was all about writing really long reports and wasting time. It required you to write\" nice and meaningful\" comments to each other online. What would actually happen is that many groups would just fake entire conversations to earn good marks and actually criticize each other's designs in person, or by another means of communication. Most of the reports you'll have to prepare as a team will also be quite lengthy and time consuming. It's way worse if you're the only one doing any of the work as well as it's all marked as a team effort. It may also require a lot of BS throughout. However, none of this even compares to the horror that was EGAD. This was basically a drawing class. If you are not naturally talented at drawing, be prepared to waste 3-5 hours every week per assignment and still get 50s and 60s every week. The standards are insanely high, and you'll normally have about 5 assignments every week form this half of the course alone. Freehands are definitely the worst form of torture brought upon form 1A. They're not even worth your time as you'll run out of time studying for every other class. AutoCAD and Solidworks are also taught in this class, but those assignments still take hours and hours to complete for subpar grades. The quizzes are also nearly impossible to prepare for. Overall, this course may destroy your average explicitly, or implicitly from the hours you wasted on it. It will be far easier to boost your average by doing even better in all of your other classes. Nothing about this course was enjoyable, and it paints a very bad picture for the rest of the program and field.",

High quality videos going over a lot of content that is useful for co-op. However, the course was incredibly easy. Very little critical thinking involved. It was basically memorize the slides. My routine for the course was to binge the~ 1 hour of weekly content on 2x speed, then do the weekly quiz. Our lab was replaced by a research report which was very disappointing. In summary, while the content was useful, I really wish there was more application and that we had done the labs. They should have either sent us out hardware, or required us to purchase it. It really sucked not getting to do the lab, as the research report was trivial and didn't contribute to my abilities as a CE student",

The DCAP side of things were dry but very useful. Report writing is important for co-ops and most courses in the program. Not a ton of freedom for the project( building a toy) but it was fun.

Keeping up with the weekly problem sets and quizzes is highly recommended. Exam questions are often recycled from past stuff with a few numbers changed, so having a good understanding of the course week-by-week is extremely beneficial over catching up last minute.

My prof makes us purchase a textbook( other students who had different profs did not have to buy one). I personally didn't purchase one and was still able to get a 95 in the course. You just have to only write about the readings that weren't found in the textbook. In the worst case, you can google the titles of some of the textbook readings and sometimes you find the exact article. I'm pretty sure the course structure heavily depends on the professor( that's why difficulty of the course also depends). With Judy, all our assignments were written, while one of my friends had to make a video recording for his final. Either way, the course will still be very easy no matter the prof you get.",

Most software engineers undervalue how important and how hard it is to build a good UI that balances usefulness with usability. I think this course does a very good job of convincing you otherwise. The lectures cover some of the most useful concepts that help with building technology in the real world. In the lectures that I've attended so far( which is a strict subset of all the lectures so far), not only have we covered desktop/ mobile user interfaces and how to design them, but, off the top of my head, I can recall lectures that have covered web architectures, productizing new technologies, ubiquitous computing/ IoT, speculations on future input devices, and machine learning. Obviously not all of those concepts are covered deeply, i. e. they're generally covered as much as is necessary to introduce usability challenges, but the fact that they're introduced and covered in ( sometimes surprising ) detail is really awesome. Assignments are slightly tedious.",

For the most part, the videos covered everything you need but for some weeks the videos were scuffed in that they assumed you had knowledge that you didn't have yet- in these cases, I'd recommend taking a look in the textbook. Greg Rice's in-person , weekly tutorials were godly- they covered the whole week's content+ good examples+ some hints about what to expect on the exams. Overall, the course was pretty light imo though I know some people struggled with the timing on exams( not enough time to finish), so make sure you practice that when prepping for exams. My biggest piece of advice( for online delivery) would be to get used to using R commands for calculating distributions- they make your life a lot easier & save time on exams.",

Looking back at Canada's colonial past and really understanding the racist roots was eye-opening. The course was divided into 8 quizzes( best 6/8 for final mark), a 40% final and 40% group project. The course material was good just the prof was completely unorganized. Lecture material was just discussed and it wasn't apparent what was important / useful. We were told on the syllabus we would write 8 quizzes and only 6 were given, which gave some confusion. The midterm was fair, though it was all short answers. The group project was frustrating in that as a result of lack of time and planning, some groups did not feel rushed while others had to stay 25 minutes past class in order to present for about 3 minutes because group members had other commitments. It was unfair how some students didn't have to worry about this while other groups did, and this was 30% of the final mark. Overall, the course material is great just lack of organization made for a frustrating semester",

This course is so useful to anyone looking to become a researcher or scientist in the future as it teaches you how to communicate scientific research. However, my professor was so unnecessarily strict on grading the assignments by nitpicking every little thing. I had many other science courses to complete, so I didn't have the time to do the discussion boards worth a good chunk of marks, and I rushed and got them completed at the end( minimum 250 words each). There were so many lectures that I did not have the time to watch. I could not get a 90% on the major annotated bibliography/ report/ presentation/ poster assignments even though they were all well-done, given the workload I had. I would always get really high marks on these types of assignments in high school, and I was doing the best I could. My professor literally wanted every little thing to be perfect, but I couldn't realistically make my work that high-quality due to my course load, I'm still surprised I even got those assignments done in the first place...",

Most of the course was based on reading from articles, making presentations and then writing based on those presentations. The final group project is a group debate, so I think you need to be comfortable with speaking spontaneously in this course. Of course the people taking this course are generally at much higher levels too( I was surprised that some people were even eligible to take the course based on their fluency, LOL). But overall, I think the course is not that hard if you have enough motivation. Also there's no final exam.",

I easily spent more time in ONE lab of this course than my entire elective and ALL other labs combined. You learn a lot, I guess, but it's not worth it at all. Irene, the lab instructor, is incredibly nice though, but I think she* hast* to be because otherwise I'd have strangled her to death with how huge these labs are. The course content is somewhat interesting, though Patrick is unfortantely not very engaging. Due to how ridiculously heavy the labs are and the fact that it has no midterm, it is so, SO easy to fall behind in this course. The final exam was absolutely brutal- less so than 380, but this one especially hurts since it's a programming course. The Final was MCQ and TF which sucked ass. Class average was 66% for the final, which is one of the worst averages I've seen. Prof also released the Final grades before finals ended, which was also terrible. All in all, one of the best courses I've taken in Waterloo, but I also hated it while I as taking it. The concepts themselves may not be as relevant to you as 250/252( unless you work on RTOS) but the skills you learn through the Lab Project are pretty important.",

This is my own fault but I left the first lab activity until the day of and freaked out over the amount of work that had to be done. About a month after I finished that activity( and after I had handed in 3 extra assignments) I got the first lab activity back, and my TA docked marks for stuff I didn't know I needed to include( because it wasn't in the rubric). About half way through I honestly considered dropping it but I'm glad I didn't because after the first couple assignments it gets so much less stressful. I almost bombed the first lab report but got almost perfect on the second one so I cant complain too much. After I got my first lab back I found out I got reported to the dean for an academic offence because I didn't cite something properly, and then I found out the TAs went crazy with reporting and almost half the class thought they were gonna get kicked out of school. Unnecessary stress honestly. Most of the stuff isn't clear in terms of the rubric, but the experiment post labs are easy 90s so that will bump your mark up if you didn't do great on the first lab report.",

        "text": "They say this is a continuation to AFM373, but this course is way easier. I think when Blake and Ecclestone taught this before, it was actually hard, but with Alan Huang and JAD, it's not that bad. The only problem is, it's too easy and the things you learn are too useless. 373 focused a lot on valuations, DCF, synergies and financial modelling. This course was purely theoretical and bsing. Our final exam on derivatives, had no derivatives in it and was rather a strategies case like AFM433. While in equities from Alan Huang we learned some interesting theories, they are not that practical in real life. Ecclestone would let students do stock simulations and so on, this course has none of those practical applications. It almost feels like they try too hard not to teach students finance( knowing this is for CPA students), it seems like we didn't learn much in this course. Presentations take up way too much time. Students are just not paying attention whenever people are presenting, there's nothing to do. Yet we should have spent that time wasted on actually learning finance. Peer critiquing was a big problem too. People just snake each other no matter how well you do. This course is very disorganized and you honestly don't learn any finance. If you are actually interested, take 424+ 322. This course is rushed in a way that you don't even get to go too deep on any topic. Derivatives was especially plain. All the hedging stuff you learned from AFM121. Grading was also very subjective. When you are at 4B, the people who mark your finance cases are\" industry professionals\". But they are very unprofessional when they mark stuff, taking marks off for things such as no page numbers , formatting , or font size. Marks wise it is ok. Everyone got around high 70s to 80s. The profs are nice too. It's just that the course itself is not very useful. They honestly should just make AFM students mandatory taking afm424 and 322. CPA has changed, and a crash course like 479 is no longer relevant for newer afm students who have many electives to spare.",

It was definitely a bird course too, only three essays throughout the entire term with a few little assignments here and there sprinkled throughout the term. I spent little time on this course each week but when the essays were due I had to spend more time writing, which was bothersome when I had some other things due around the same time. I took this course online and I did not really like that aspect, but I think it would be better than going to lectures. They really emphasized revision in the course so you had to submit a draft paper for peer review, a\" final for now\" paper, and then for a final portfolio, where you had to submit two essays which you revised again. The draft papers I submitted for review were rushed just to meet the deadline and the\" final for now\" paper was the one getting marked so that is when I spent some time actually trying to write well. The final portfolio is where they ask you to resubmit all your work for these two essays and a final reflection. I submitted my best two essays and this was a mistake. I did not change them significantly because I was unsure what I needed to do for the final revision, so I ended up with a worse mark on my portfolio than the marks I received the first time around for the essays. Overall, an okay course.",

As a MAcc alumni, she wants to integrate a lot of real-life situations and cases into the course. It is quite useful to have to research and apply to real life situations. But she did not emphasize a lot on textbook use. You can pretty much skip the entire term and still do well on the cases by researching yourself. Thing about cases is that, it cannot cover every possible topic. I feel like I did not get to learn a lot of things that may have been important, but since there were literally no evaluation on them, no one did the readings or cared about it. Most students don't do any prep work and still did really well in the course. While this course is useful, easy and very practical, I think it needs to be more organized and considers the fact that there are many non-saf students taking the course as well.

For example, we have quizzes that run Friday to Monday, and this specific Monday we had a midterm for 112. However, Professor Babaie did not upload the midterm until Monday at 3 : 00pm. Professor Babaie has also decided to copy all of the late Professor Igor Ivkovic's slides, however, he is missing the wonderful lectures that accompany the slides. This Professor is so lazy that the feedback form he uploaded for students to fill out was directly copied from Igor Ivkovic, he did not even bother changing the questions or answers. This was evident when the number 42 was mentioned despite Professor Babaie never having mentioned that. I am honestly disgusted that the department of Systems Design Engineering would allow someone who is so unprofessional, disorganized , and lazy to teach the 2025 cohort. In conclusion, if Professor Babaie is teaching this course then have fun making it rain with tears and sadness.",

The courses are of high quality, and the University is able to retain a high number of world-leading academics. The courses are well designed and stretch your ability. Many of the History modules were structured around the lecturer's current research, and this is the same in many programmes. The campus is lovely , very green , and with lots of facilities. Exeter city is big enough for a University town , and is in a perfect location for the Coast, Dartmoor and not too far from Bristol. Having worked at the University, I have seen how dedicated staff members are, and a lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes that students don't see. There are hundreds of student societies , and volunteer groups- honestly, and cater to a wide range of audiences. Exeter has a middle-class reputation, but there is much more than this.",

Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.\" While we did look at specific software like MS Word, Excel, FileMaker, etc., all of the units were accompanied by pearls that taught you how to apply what you're learning to almost any software. After taking this course, not only do I feel comfortable using some of the most common programs like MS word and Excel, but I am not afraid to explore new software if I have to. My favourite part about the course was the fact that along with learning the technical skills, it also teaches you how to be resourceful. The course is very well organized. The professor, Barbara, makes an active effort to keep students engaged( through fun discussions on Teams) and is incredibly helpful during office hours. The assignments are reasonable and actually help you learn. There is plenty of help and a lot of resources available to help you through the assignments.",

        "text": "I truly loved the course, and thanks to this course , I learned the spirit of Math and the art of solving difficult problems. The course is definitely the most challenging Math course you will ever take by the time you take this course( i. e., 2nd year). Although, it is recommended to take this during 2b with the stats knowledge you learned from 2a, I went with this course straight away in 2a. I would say the knowledge of stats would have helped me in the very beginning for enumeration , but really , it ain't that much, so do not worry if you are taking it in 2a. Now the course content- SUPER interesting. The enumeration part was very challenging and very rewarding as well. I especially loved the bijection and strings / ambiguity parts. I found the problems to be very challenging at first, but you will find yourself slowly building the intuitions-- which was super rewarding! I personally found the exams( 3 exams total) to be very straightforward compared to assignments( the assignment average marks are around 70-90 in enumeration, and 40-60 in graph theory). I wouldn't graph theory isn't any easier than the other , but it sure is interesting and the questions can be \" kinda \" predictable once you practice a good chunk of it. Overall, super fun and super difficult!",

I personally did not use the textbook other than to cite and reference for 120L and to study for the exam. The course is scary and a little intimidating, but push through; it is absolutely possible to pass with 90 %+. I was close with an 89%. Midterms and exam were alright, I found the exam easier than all the midterms. Be sure you understand your stoichiometry and all things quantum( VSEPR, orbitals, hybridization, etc.). Good luck!",

        "text": "I made this account specifically to review this course. My main complaint is regarding the time it takes to mark and how deliverables are marked. I got a 65% for the 1/3 case studies but did not receive the mark and any sort of feedback until i finished the second case study. I wanted to request a regrade but the professor created an announcement stating that you MUST wait 48 hours before approaching the professor. If marking and feedback is already so late, why are you asking the students to wait longer? This policy was deleted from the announcements in the W22 term but benefited the professor rather than the students. The professor and the TA's do not provide any meaningful help. With a hybrid system, i was confused if a midterm was online or in person. The response from the TA was\" check Learn\" when Learn did not provide any information in the announcements OR from the syllabus. A\" yes\" or\" no\" would have been sufficient. The content itself is really interesting and opened my vision of just how big tourism is. The deliverables are fine and make you think deeper about the mechanics of tourism. I actually enjoyed the content of the course a lot despite the teaching method. If you are interested in tourism, beware of the issues above.",

By far the easiest and most enjoyable calculus course out of the three calculus courses. Assessments consisted of Mobius assignments( 20%), Written assignments( 60%) and a final exam( 20%). Mobius had unlimited attempts and the written assignments were manageable if you put in the time. The course was online but the instructors were always active on piazza and at the end of each week they would post \" weekly recap \" videos which really helped me understand the content better. I highly recommend taking this course!",

The study spaces are great to work in, ample opportunity to be comfortable at your own desk with a view. Although, a downfall is that the internet connection requires a password which you have to go to IT to find out, otherwise you will be logging into the wifi system every 20-40 minutes which is quite annoying. The Careers Service is great in offering lots of opportunities for talks and events to attend about CV writing and cover letter, but a little more help on one to one meetings talking about applications wouldn't go un-appreciated. Altogether however a lovely University that is supportive and thriving with opportunity.",

Another thing that was irritating was that they kept running out of TA marking hours so they only marked about 60 % of the questions.",

However, the course gets drastically easier as it goes on( And after you catch up on all the Math 136 content). It becomes extremely interesting, and it\u2019s one of my all time favourite courses now.

I don't know how it'll be on campus but she made it necessarily hard with covid. Prof also kinda thinks everyone is dumb?? Like someone complained about being unfair and she copy and pasted the email, and went on about how she's the' fairest' professor you would ever get. Break down wasn't too bad, 60% Midterms( 3 midterms 20% each), 20% Notetonic( Kinda like a weekly quiz), and 20% Group work.

An engaging and interesting range of texts to study were chosen, focusing on developing characters most of the students in the class had little experience with. Nice class size, although we were working individually we got many chances to engage with our peers and classmates for feedback. The assignments are fairly weighted( 10-20% for each performance or assignment), lightening the course load a lot compared to other courses that have fewer assessments weighted much heavier. Just come prepared to workshops( it's a matter of memorising your texts/ doing some independent rehearsal times) and you'll do well in this course.",

I stopped attending lectures three weeks into classes and still got an 89 in the course so that's pretty telling.

There is a lot of material but it is not hard material, just a lot of memorization. Doing well in this course is literally just about putting in a little bit of extra time to go over things, like why a muscle does this and that based on its attachment sites. This course was very well organized, even the reading week was well placed in the content because it was just after a very hard section, so i had time to wrap my head around it before starting on the next section. The exams were very fairly written and clickers were very useful for practicing because they were the exact same structure( also a 10% clicker mark is a blessing itself). You can also move the grading scheme based on how you test, if you don\u2019t think you test well, then you could do an assignment to take some of the weight off your midterms. You didn\u2019t even have to do clickers if you were likely to sleep through an 8: 30am class. Tamara posted lecture videos with everything you needed. The skeleton notes were extremely helpful and 80 % completed for you. Since everything is mostly filled in for you and you\u2019re not writing much, i made index cards to test myself during class which saved a lot of time during studying for midterms and finals which made this course even easier. Also, i really didn\u2019t want to take the lab with the course because I already had other labs but it was 100 % worth it! But those bell ringer exams were a little trickier. By far my favourite course i have ever taken( also the best grade I have ever achieved)",
